PongButNot
Project Goals:
My goal was to create a pong style game except you need to dodge instead of hitting the object.

Instructions:
Left player is controlled by W an S. The right player is controlled by the UP ARROW and the DOWN ARROW. You need to dodge the fireball. The first to lose all their lives loses and the other wins.

Description of the process:
I used python and the modules pygame and SimpleGE.
I used some code from previous projects.
I tried to get the fireball to speed up everytime it hit a wall and everytime it hit a player, however, I got stuck on trying to fix a bug where the fireball would gltich out and eliminate players instantly. I ultimately removed that feature. I would like to get that working again. I moved pretty far from my orignal plans as I had either run out of time or couldn't figure it out. I kept the main basis of the game in still.
